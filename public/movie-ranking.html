<h1>The Best Movies According to Connor Blaha</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of 2023</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spiderman across the spiderverse</h3>
<p>To say this movie is thrilling is an understatement. This movie far exceeds the expectations
    of all past spiderman movies and sets a new standard for future spiderman movies to live up to.</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>A great movie about the father of the atomic bomb. I'd highly recommend to anyone.</p>
<h3>Vinland Saga season 2</h3>
<p>This isn't a movie but the series is just too good to leave off the list. 
    The message 'you have no enemies' is really rung home as Thorfinn accepts who he was and attempts to be better.
    I'd highly recommend to both anime and non anime loving audiences.
